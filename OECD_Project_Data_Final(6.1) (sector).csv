After analysing the context, support to contribute to climate-smart agriculture in southern Iraq was identified as a relevant and suitable area of intervention. FAO was judged to have the right competence and capacity and was asked to develop a full-scale project proposal. In brief, the project aims to address the challenges described above by improving water use in agriculture and to contribute to improved land and water productivity and in particular by improving the efficiency of irrigation systems. The project will work with Iraqi actors who provide advice to farmers so that these in turn can support farmers to adopt improved climate-adapted cultivation methods to a greater extent. Furthermore, the project aims to strengthen institutions responsible for water management and distribution of water resources. The expected result is an improved living situation for women and men and an improved resilience of vulnerable rural communities in Missan, Al-Muthanna, Najaf and Thi-Qar in southern Iraq. In two of these regions, Najaf and Al-Muthanna, the Sida-financed project will co-finance efforts together with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) project  Strengthening climate Resilience of Vulnerable Agriculture Livelihoods in Iraq , provided that Iraq  s GCF application is approved. The project areas have been identified based on factors that included vulnerability to the impact of climate change on food security. To ensure that the project contributes to the broader aspects of sustainability, FAO will pilot its Climate Smart Agriculture plus approach (CSA+) to improve in particular: (i) gender equality and inclusiveness, (ii) anti-corruption/improved governance, (iii) balanced ecosystems and biodiversity and (iv) reduced land, water and air pollution.","Sweden, Swedish International Development Authority",58,28,58,2100

This 4-year programme will be conducted during 2018-2021 with a total budget of 320 MSEK, which will be evenly divided between the financial years. This contribution will be financed by three Swedish strategies: Sustainable Peace, Afghanistan and Iraq. The Sustainable Peace strategy will provide 200 MSEK while the other two bilateral strategies will contribute 60 MSEK each. The funding from the Sustaining Peace strategy has a tentative allocation of 160 MSEK to mine action and 40 MSEK to SALW.  DDG is an integral part of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and DRC is therefore the legal entity signing the agreement for this project and will be responsible for the funds transferred to MAG. The country focus of the Sustainable Peace component finance will be determined on an annual basis to provide flexibility for adapting changing needs. DDG/MAG does, however, have long term strategies for most of the countries they are active in, since mine action require a long-term focus. The contributions that will be implemented through Sustainable Peace will focus on mines, cluster ammunition and other explosive remnants in the following eleven countries during 2018:-DDG is planning on implementing contributions in Algeria (with focus on West Saharan refugee camps), Colombia, Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.   -MAG is planning on implementing contributions in Bosnia Herzegovina, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.When deciding on where to work the aim has been to include both contexts with a focus on facilitating humanitarian response and contexts more focused on supporting the commitments toward the mine- and cluster conventions. This is also done to balance the risk profile of the intervention since countries with on-going conflicts pose higher risks in a number of areas. Regarding SALW, DDG plan to focus on Guinea (as well as one additional country in West Africa) while MAG will work with SALW in Somalia.The contribution in Afghanistan will be implemented by DDG alone since MAG is not active there, and Iraq will be the only country where both DDG and MAG will be implement the programme during 2018. This programme is a continuation of earlier support from Sida where the Sustainable Peace strategy has contributed to DDG and MAG during 2015-2017 as well as earlier Sida support to DDG in Afghanistan during 2010-2016.

After years of armed conflict, the need for funding for the recovery and reconstruction of Iraq is big. In total, the cost of recovery and reconstruction is estimated at $ 88 billion.The Iraqi government has developed a Recovery, Reconstruction and Development Plan (RRDP), which includes the establishment of a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MTDF). Its aim is to effectively co-finance international partners to support effective investment, facilitate dialogue, share information and coordinate Iraq s reform program, which forms the basis of the I3RF, whose objectives, structure and scope are closely aligned with the RRDP.The work takes place in close contact with the Iraqi government, donors and INGOs. I3RF s activities will be carried out by the Iraqi government, organizations, and VB to enable maximum response to reforms and reconstruction needs and to ensure national political ownership. To ensure that there is also a sense and will for ownership within the framework of the fund s results, the I3RF Secretariat has facilitated the creation of a policy document (White Paper) by the Iraqi government, with feedback from donors, which will be a leading document for the government s plan to tackle reform issues within the framework of the fund.The fund has three overall areas of activity, Socio-economic recovery, with a focus on the reconstruction of urban areas, institution building, development of social capital, rehabilitation of cultural heritage, improving the provision of services to people in poverty and vulnerability, and the creation of job opportunities for vulnerable groups.

The decision is made in accordance with Sida's contribution management rule, paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.In accordance with Sida's humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC's humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection. The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida's ambition to increase our partner's predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida assesses NRC's country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020, as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida's humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC's Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises. Furthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action, to NRC's internal work on 'Digital Transformation' and to NRC's work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms, the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).

However, there will also be growing numbers of people returning to areas no longer under the control of ISIL who will also need assistance to help restart their lives.   With GAC's support, the project is building the resilience of IDPs, remainees and returnees, to enable them to cope with the impact of the crisis through social awareness and improved access to income. The project will: (1) provide primary, reproductive, maternal and child health care to up to 60,720 displaced people in camps, and (2) provide temporary employment activities and emergency livelihood assets to conflict-affected people returning to areas of origin.

More people will be displaced by the conflict, while many will remain displaced in camps and host communities. However, there will also be growing numbers of people returning to areas no longer under the control of Daesh who will also need assistance to help restart their lives.   With GAC's support, Islamic Relief Canada is contributing by meeting the health, psychosocial and protection needs of vulnerable Iraqi women and girls affected by sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). Project activities include: (1) establishing women and girls centres to provide assistance and a safe space for psychosocial first aid, counselling and recreational activities for up to 244,000 beneficiaries, (2) improving the coverage and referral system of basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care services and family planning services, (3) developing case identification and referral pathways, and follow-up of cases for survivors of SGBV, (4) providing psychosocial support to up to 48,000 women, girls and survivors of SGBV, (5) training social workers on life skills and peer education, and conduct education for up to 36,000 adolescent girls and women, and (6) organizing community and religious events to raise awareness on SGBV and child and early forced marriages (CEFM).

Sweden's humanitarian assistance is needs-based and Sida each year undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all humanitarian crises are analysed, and where the partners most relevant to respond to the identified needs are selected.A number of the identified global needs for 2018 are found in protracted and forgotten crises, and Sida believes that Oxfam GB is well positioned to respond to these needs as the organization is also working with long-term development cooperation. Moreover, Oxfam GB has extensive knowledge of the local context in all proposed projects and capacity building of local actors is central to Oxfam GB's humanitarian work. In 2018-2021, it is therefore suggested that Oxfam GB receives support for emergency lifesaving activities as well as funding for longer-term activities aimed at strengthening societies' resilience to crises and disasters.Oxfam GB has in previous collaborations with Sida demonstrated that the organisation is a professional and efficient humanitarian actor, most recently in the agreements during 2011-2013 and 2014-2017. In 2016 alone, Oxfam GB managed to reach 1.2 million people with humanitarian support in the sector of WASH, 94,000 people with food security and livelihood interventions and 106,000 people with protection assistance in conflict-affected settings. In line with this, Sida believes that Oxfam GB has an added value when it comes to activities of food security and livelihoods, WASH and protection. Moreover, Sida assesses that Oxfam GB's planned projects are relevant in accordance with Sida's Humanitarian Crisis Analyses (HCA) that form the basis for the allocation of a majority of the humanitarian funds for 2018 and contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Strategy for Sweden's humanitarian aid provided through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 2017??020. Sida therefore proposes to support Oxfam GB's humanitarian projects to a cost of 104 MSEK.In 2018-2021, Oxfam GB plans to reach over 280,000 people in Algeria, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq and Chad.
