Currently, there is only one scientific institute responsible for overseeing quality management in the region. All products, including food, medical treatments, and chemicals, are sent to this facility for testing and approval before being released to the market. However, since its establishment in 2006, the institute has faced numerous challenges due to its aging infrastructure and limited capacity. As the local market in Kurdistan continues to grow each year, the current facility is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the entire region. This project will address these challenges by establishing a modern scientific institute equipped with multiple experimental laboratories and state-of-the-art testing equipment. The new institute will serve as the primary approval authority for all products in Kurdistan, including both commercial and industrial goods. Additionally, the Republic of Korea will offer professional training to scientists and policymakers to ensure the successful implementation of the new quality control system in the region.

Currently, there is only one scientific institute responsible for overseeing quality management in the region. All products, including food, medical treatments, and chemicals, are sent to this facility for testing and approval before being released to the market. However, since its establishment in 2006, the institute has faced numerous challenges due to its aging infrastructure and limited capacity. As the local market in Kurdistan continues to grow each year, the current facility is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the entire region. This project will address these challenges by establishing a modern scientific institute equipped with multiple experimental laboratories and state-of-the-art testing equipment. The new institute will serve as the primary approval authority for all products in Kurdistan, including both commercial and industrial goods.

It contributes to the two goals of the Swedish strategy for development cooperation with Iraq 2017-2021, to contribute to peaceful and inclusive societies and gender equality. As a large part of the population was forced to flee due to the violent conflicts in Iraq, there is now a big need to create livelihood opportunities for people returning and for people living in poverty. Oxfam's proposal with the aim to strengthen women's economic empowerment and resilience among the population living in conflict affected areas through increased access to safe and sustainable livelihood within the agricultural sector, is well-aligned with the goals in the Iraq strategy. With a specific focus on women, the project aims to contribute to women's economic participation and empowerment within the frames of the strategy.

Therefore it is very important to contribute to increased opportunities for a safe and sustainable return.
